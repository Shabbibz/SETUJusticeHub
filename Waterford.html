        <h3>Public Transport</h3>
        <p>Waterford have its very own Bus and Train station, as well as TFI Bikes you can rent to cycle for a certain period of time. Some students might not have their full driving liceances, therefore, it's important to consider if planning to live in Waterford, how you will travel from location to location. Waterford has TFI city busses that have their own set time scedules and if a student has a student leap card, they can get on these buses for only 60 cent a trip, this is a fair price as most public transports can be quite costly. Train fares can differ depending on where your based, however they are still a reliable mode of public transport especially for comfort for longer journeys. Cycling is also a cheap option for transport, not to mention better for your health. If you manage to get close accommodation your the college however, walking is always a good option. For a student currently attending SETU my personal favourite mode of public transport would be the buses, they're low in cost and times are suitable for college lecture's start times.</p>
