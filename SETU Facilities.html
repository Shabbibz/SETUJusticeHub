        <h3>Library</h3>
        <p>The SETU Library services eagerly anticipate your arrival at SETU and are dedicated to assisting you with your academic endeavors. Also, if you are a student for any SETU college, you have the option of using any library owned by SETU, examples being Carlow or Wexford <br>
          <br>
          Our priority is to offer inviting, cozy, and encouraging atmospheres conducive to studying, learning, researching, and collaborating. Our services span across the campuses in Waterford, Carlow, Wexford, and Wicklow, with five libraries spread across these locations.<br>
          <br>
          All enrolled SETU students have the privilege of accessing any of our campus libraries. To enter the library premises and borrow books, students are required to present their student cards. What is great about the "Luke Wadding Library", is you have 3 levels. Level one and two are quite spaces for students who wish to work or study in peace, and the third level is for students who might need to speak for group assignments or studies. </p>
